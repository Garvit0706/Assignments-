    "Q1. Why We Use the Exception Class While Creating a Custom Exception\n",
    "When creating custom exceptions in Python, it is standard practice to inherit from the Exception class. This is because the Exception class is the base class for all built-in exceptions in Python, providing the necessary framework for exception handling mechanisms to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons for Using the Exception Class:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency: By inheriting from Exception, custom exceptions integrate seamlessly with Python's built-in exception handling mechanism.\n",
    "Compatibility: Custom exceptions will behave like built-in exceptions, supporting the same syntax and semantics for raising, catching, and propagating errors.\n",
    "Hierarchy: It maintains a clear exception hierarchy, making it easier to catch specific exceptions or a broad category of exceptions.\n",
    "Functionality: The Exception class provides useful methods and properties (like __str__ and __repr__) that enhance the functionality of custom exceptions"

    "4. Use Context Managers:\n",
    "Employ with statements for resources that need clean-up to ensure they are properly managed.\n",
    "5. Log Exceptions:\n",
    "Utilize logging to record exceptions and provide detailed information for troubleshooting.\n",
    "6. Create Custom Exceptions:\n",
    "Define custom exception classes for specific application errors to distinguish them from standard Python exceptions.\n",
    "7. Document Exception Handling:\n",
    "Document exceptions raised by functions and methods using docstrings to guide users and developers."
