    "\n",
    "Easy to Learn and Use: Flask's simplicity and well-documented nature make it easy for beginners to learn and start developing web applications quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in Development Server and Debugger: Flask includes a built-in development server and an interactive debugger, which help developers test and debug their applications efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESTful Request Dispatching: Flask supports RESTful request dispatching, making it suitable for developing RESTful APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jinja2 Templating: Flask uses the Jinja2 templating engine, which allows for the creation of dynamic HTML content with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrated Unit Testing: Flask supports unit testing out of the box, helping developers to write and run tests for their applications."

    "3. What is App Routing in Flask? Why Do We Use App Routes?\n",
    "App routing in Flask refers to mapping URLs to functions that handle the logic for those URLs. This is done using the @app.route() decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use App Routes?\n",
    "\n",
    "URL Handling: App routes help in defining how URLs should be processed and what responses should be returned.\n",
