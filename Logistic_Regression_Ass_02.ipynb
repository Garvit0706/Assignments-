    "Purpose: Grid Search Cross-Validation (CV) is used to systematically search for the best hyperparameters for a machine learning model by exhaustively trying all possible combinations of a specified parameter grid.\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "Define the model and a grid of hyperparameters to tune.\n",
    "Perform cross-validation for each combination of hyperparameters.\n",
    "Evaluate the performance for each combination and select the one with the best performance metrics.\n",
    "The best hyperparameters are then used to train the final model.\n",
    "Example: If tuning a Random Forest, you might define a grid of values for the number of trees (n_estimators) and the maximum depth of the trees (max_depth). Grid Search CV will try all possible combinations and evaluate them using cross-validation."
