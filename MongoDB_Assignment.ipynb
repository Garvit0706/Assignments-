    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL, document-oriented database.\n",
    "It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, allowing for dynamic schema design.\n",
    "Uses collections and documents instead of tables and rows.\n",
    "Non-Relational Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases (NoSQL) are designed to handle a variety of data models, including document, key-value, graph, and column-family stores.\n",
    "They provide flexibility in data storage and retrieval, making them suitable for hierarchical data storage, large-scale data, and rapid development.\n",
    "Preferred Scenarios for MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "When the data model is unstructured or semi-structured.\n",
    "When rapid development and iteration are needed.\n",
    "When horizontal scalability and high availability are critical.\n",
    "When dealing with large volumes of data and requiring high performance."
