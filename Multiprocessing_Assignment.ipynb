    "Q1. What is multiprocessing in Python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python refers to the capability of creating and running multiple processes simultaneously to execute tasks. Each process runs independently, making use of multiple CPUs and cores available on a system. It is useful for CPU-bound tasks that can be parallelized, as it allows for true parallel execution, unlike threading which is limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python"

It provides a high-level interface for distributing work across multiple processes efficiently. It is used to parallelize the execution of a function across multiple input values, managing the creation and destruction of worker processes automatically."
