    "Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening\n",
    "The open() function is used to open a file in Python. The different modes of opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r': Read (default mode). Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist.\n",
    "'w': Write. Opens a file for writing, creates a new file if it does not exist or truncates the file if it exists.\n",
    "'a': Append. Opens a file for appending, creates a new file if it does not exist.\n",
    "'b': Binary mode. Used for binary files (e.g., images). Can be combined with other modes (e.g., 'rb' or 'wb').\n",
    "'t': Text mode (default mode). Can be combined with other modes (e.g., 'rt' or 'wt').\n",
    "'x': Exclusive creation. Creates a new file and opens it for writing, returns an error if the file exists.\n",
    "'+': Update. Opens a file for updating (reading and writing). Can be combined with other modes (e.g., 'r+', 'w+', 'a+')."

    "Free up system resources: Open files consume system resources, and closing them releases these resources.\n",
