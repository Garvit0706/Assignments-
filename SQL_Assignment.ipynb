    "1. A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. SQL and NoSQL are two main types of databases. SQL databases are relational databases that use SQL (Structured Query Language) for managing data, while NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that use different methods for data management such as key-value stores, document stores, and graph databases."

A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table, which is used to ensure data integrity and consistency.

    "   cursor(): The cursor() method creates a cursor object that is used to execute SQL statements and fetch data from the result set. A cursor is a control structure that enables traversal over the records in a database. Once a cursor is created, you can use it to execute SQL queries and fetch the results.\n",

The execute() method can also be used to execute stored procedures, and it supports parameter binding to prevent SQL injection attacks. When you execute an SQL statement, the database returns a result set that can be used to fetch data."
