    "Q1. Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It provides tools and techniques for making sense of data and drawing conclusions from it. Statistics is used in a wide range of fields, including science, engineering, social sciences, business, and finance."

    "Descriptive statistics: Descriptive statistics are used to describe the basic features of a dataset, such as the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation. Descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the data and provide insights into its characteristics. For example, the mean salary of employees in a company, the median age of customers, or the mode of transportation used by commuters.  \n",

    "Inferential statistics: Inferential statistics are used to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population based on a sample. Inferential statistics involve hypothesis testing and estimation, and are used to test whether a hypothesis is true or not. For example, inferential statistics can be used to determine if there is a significant difference between the salaries of male and female employees in a company, or if there is a relationship between the age of customers and their purchasing behavior."

    "Q6. It is important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data because it determines the types of statistical tests and analyses that can be performed on the data. For example, nominal data can only be analyzed using non-parametric tests, while ratio data can be analyzed using both parametric and non-parametric tests. Understanding the level of measurement also helps in selecting appropriate visualization techniques and interpreting the results of statistical analyses.\n",

    "For example, if we are analyzing the relationship between income and education level, understanding that income is a ratio variable and education level is an ordinal variable helps us select appropriate statistical tests to analyze the relationship. We can use a t-test or ANOVA to test for differences in income between different education levels, but we cannot use these tests to compare income between different categories of a nominal variable like gender."

    "Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It is useful in describing the extent of variation in a distribution.\n",

    "Variance: The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean. It is useful in describing the amount of variation in a dataset.\n",

For example, the mean and standard deviation can be used to describe the center and spread of a normally distributed dataset, while the median and range can be used to describe the center and spread of a skewed dataset with outliers."
